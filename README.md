# Discord Catfish Bullshit lol.

I don't really know but, if you're going to use the code please, PLEASE, provide credit.

Disclaimer;

As of now the tool does not have an API intergrated to check if its an exact match, meaning if google comes back with a "match" which could be anything from an item of clothing to a ring, it'll send as a "catfish", I've open sourced this as I do not have the funding to pay for an API that handles all the "detection", if any developers would like to come forward and reccomend me an API I could use please message me on discord, on this note this is open source, I would like credit but not needed so fuck the MIT license lol, anyway if you decide to use this tool make sure you can read the code lol, it's pretty shit.

Anyway, if you are going to use the code change example.env to just .env and put your bot token after ( token= your token ) any issues please contact me via Discord.
